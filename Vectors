Exercises:
a. Create and store a sequence of values from 5 to −11 that progresses in steps of 0.3.

b. Overwrite the object from (a) using the same sequence with the order reversed.

c. Repeat the vector c(-1,3,-5,7,-9) twice, with each element repeated 10 times, and store the result. Display the result sorted from largest to smallest.

d. Create and store a vector that contains, in any configuration, the following:
1. A sequence of integers from 6 to 12 (inclusive)
2. A threefold repetition of the value 5.3
3. The number −3
4. A sequence of nine values starting at 102 and ending at the number that is the total length of the vector created in (c)

e. Confirm that the length of the vector created in (d) is 20.


Exercises:
a. Create and store a vector that contains the following, in this order:
1. A sequence of length 5 from 3 to 6 (inclusive)
2. A twofold repetition of the vector c(2,-5.1,-33)
3. The value 7/42 + 2

b. Extract the first and last elements of your vector from (a), storing them as a new object.

c. Store as a third object the values returned by omitting the first and last values of your vector from (a).

d. Use only (b) and (c) to reconstruct (a).

e. Overwrite (a) with the same values sorted from smallest to largest.

f. Use the colon operator as an index vector to reverse the order of (e), and confirm this is identical to using sort on (e) with decreasing=TRUE.

g. Create a vector from (c) that repeats the third element of (c) three times, the sixth element four times, and the last element once.

h. Create a new vector as a copy of (e) by assigning (e) as is to a newly named object. Using this new copy of (e), overwrite the first, the fifth to the 
seventh (inclusive), and the last element with the values 99 to 95 (inclusive), respectively.


Exercises:
a. Convert the vector c(2,0.5,1,2,0.5,1,2,0.5,1) to a vector of only 1s, using a vector of length 3.

b. The conversion from a temperature measurement in degrees Fahrenheit F to Celsius C is performed using the following equation: C = 5/9(F − 32)
Use vector-oriented behavior in R to convert the temperatures 45, 77, 20, 19, 101, 120, and 212 in degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.

c. Use the vector c(2,4,6) and the vector c(1,2) in conjunction with rep and * to produce the vector c(2,4,6,4,8,12).

d. Overwrite the middle four elements of the resulting vector from (c) with the two recycled values -0.1 and -100, in that order.
