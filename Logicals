Exercise Set 1:
a. Store the following vector of 15 values as an object in your workspace: c(6,9,7,3,6,7,9,6,3,6,6,7,1,9,1). Identify the following elements:
i. Those equal to 6
ii. Those greater than or equal to 6
iii. Those less than 6 + 2
iv. Those not equal to 6

b. Create a new vector from the one used in (a) by deleting its first three elements. With this new vector, fill a 2 × 2 × 3 array. 
Examine the array for the following entries:
i. Those less than or equal to 6 divided by 2, plus 4
ii. Those less than or equal to 6 divided by 2, plus 4, after
increasing every element in the array by 2

c. Confirm the specific locations of elements equal to 0 in the 10 × 10 identity matrix I10 (see Section 3.3).

d. Check whether any of the values of the logical arrays created in (b) are TRUE. If they are, check whether they are all TRUE.

e. By extracting the diagonal elements of the logical matrix created in (c), use any to confirm there are no TRUE entries.



Exercise Set 2:
a. Store the vector c(7,1,7,10,5,9,10,3,10,8) as foo. Identify the elements greater than 5 OR equal to 2.

b. Store the vector c(8,8,4,4,5,1,5,6,6,8) as bar. Identify the elements less than or equal to 6 AND not equal to 4.

c. Identify the elements that satisfy (a) in foo AND satisfy (b) in bar.

d. Store a third vector called baz that is equal to the element-wisesum of foo and bar. Determine the following:
i. The elements of baz greater than or equal to 14 but not equal to 15
ii. The elements of the vector obtained via an element-wise division of baz by foo that are greater than 4 OR less than or equal to 2

e. Confirm that using the long version in all of the preceding exercises performs only the first comparison (that is, the results each match the first 
   entries of the previously obtained vectors).



Exercise Set 3:
a. Store this vector of 10 values: foo <- c(7,5,6,1,2,10,8,3,8,2). Then, do the following:
i. Extract the elements greater than or equal to 5, storing the result as bar.
ii. Display the vector containing those elements from foo that remain after omitting all elements that are greater than or equal to 5.

b. Use bar from (a)(i) to construct a 2 × 3 matrix called baz, filled in a row-wise fashion. Then, do the following:
i. Replace any elements that are equal to 8 with the squared value of the element in row 1, column 2 of baz itself.
ii. Confirm that all values in baz are now less than or equal to 25 AND greater than 4.

c. Create a 3 × 2 × 3 array called qux using the following vector of 18 values: c(10,5,1,4,7,4,3,3,1,3,4,3,1,7,8,3,7,3). Then, do the following:
i. Identify the dimension-specific index positions of elements that are either 3 OR 4.
ii. Replace all elements in qux that are less than 3 OR greater than or equal to 7 with the value 100.

d. Return to foo from (a). Use the vector c(F,T) to extract every second value from foo. In Section 4.1.4, you saw that in somesituations, you can 
   substitute 0 and 1 for TRUE and FALSE. Can you perform the same extraction from foo using the vector c(0,1)? Why or why not? What does R return in this case?
