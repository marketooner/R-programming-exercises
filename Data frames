a. Create and store this data frame as dframe in your R workspace:
person   sex    funny
Stan      M     High
Francine  F     Med
Steve     M     Low
Roger     M     High
Hayley    F     Med
Klaus     M     Med

The variables person, sex, and funny should reflected in the following way: person should be a character vector, sex should be a factor 
with levels F and M, and funny should be a factor with levels Low, Med, and High.

b. Stan and Francine are 41 years old, Steve is 15, Hayley is 21, and Klaus is 60. Roger is extremely oldâ€”1,600 years. Append these data as a new numeric 
column variable in dframe called age.

c. Use your knowledge of reordering the column variables based on column index positions to overwrite dframe, bringing it in line with mydata. 
That is, the first column should be person, the second column age, the third column sex, and the fourth column funny.

d. Turn your attention to mydata as it was left after you included the age.mon variable in Section 5.2.2. Create a new version of mydata called 
mydata2 by deleting the age.mon column.

e. Now, combine mydata2 with dframe, naming the resulting object mydataframe.

f. Write a single line of code that will extract from mydataframe just the names and ages of any records where the individual is female and has a level of funniness 
equal to Med OR High.

g. Use your knowledge of handling character strings in R to extract all records from mydataframe that correspond to people whose names start with S. 
Hint: you can use regex for the pattern in grep.
