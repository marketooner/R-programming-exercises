Have you been looking for a place to practise your R skils? I've reated a set of exercises divided into folders (vectors, matrices, logicals, et cetera) that you can copy into your R script window and start your R programming journey. The exercises you will find in this repository come from various sources such as books, online courses, articles, et cetera. I will continue adding more and more exercises along the way as I solve them myself. Feel free to reach out to me in case you feel stuck with any of the exercises. I may not be an R Programming pro, but I will do my best to find answers with you :)
