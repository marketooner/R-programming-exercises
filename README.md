Have you been looking for a place to practise your R skils? I've reated a set of exercises divided into folders (vectors, matrices, logicals, et cetera) that you can manualy copy into your R script window and start your R programming journey (or use the steps provided below to copy the repo into R). The exercises you will find in this repository come from various sources such as books, online courses, articles, et cetera. I will continue adding more and more exercises along the way as I go through them myself to be sure you will benefit from them. Feel free to reach out to me in case you feel stuck with any of the exercises. I may not be an R Programming pro, but I will do my best to help you find solutions :)
